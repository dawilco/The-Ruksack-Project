# The Ruksack Project
The Ruksack Project aims to create modern, easy to use and effective registration software for BSA Scout Camps. Currently, the system is made up of an API written in Express.js, `rucksack-server` and a front end React app `ruksack-client`
## Getting dev environment up and running
The API must be running
```
cd ruksack-server && nodemon index.js
```
With the API up you can start the React App
```
cd ruksack-client && nodemon 
```
